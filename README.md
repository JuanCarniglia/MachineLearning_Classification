# MachineLearning_Classification
Doing Classification using Machine Learning and CNN

This projects demonstrates a series of points related with Classification using
tensorflow and OpenCV.

* Image Loading (as input for Machine Learning Models)
* Image Augmentation (To get a bigger training set) (With a nice progress bar)
* Training with a custom Network Model (Convolution)
* Viewing the progress of the Training
* Testing the model recognizing objects on a live webcam
* A few other things

Images should be 128x128 3 Bpp. You can of course adapt the script to handle a
different shape.


You will find it very easy to use this on a set of images of your own, by
changing just a few lines.

If you need help or want to make suggestions on how to improve the code, please
let me know.
